0.1.1 Using Figure 2 and your own understanding, suggest how plate movements cause tectonic hazards in Iceland.

In Figure 2 it shows how the mid-Atlantic Ridge travels straight through Iceland. It is on two converging plate margins which move apart to create a tectonic hazard (earthquake) on plate margins which will erupt when magma near and on the core of the earth travels to the crust and erupts from the volcano. This causes the tectonic plates to move and create an earthquake on the ground. Another way down faults to the crust however it cools and thickens the Extra Space.
