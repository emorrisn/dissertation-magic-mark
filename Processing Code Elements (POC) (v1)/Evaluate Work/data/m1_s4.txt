0.1.1 Using Figure 2 and your own understanding, suggest how plate movements cause tectonic hazards in Iceland.

In Figure 2, it shows # a plate margin in Iceland. And volcanos Earthquakes are occurring in and around the plate margin area. There are also evidence proven "Several hundred earthquakes are recorded in Iceland every year." This suggests as the plates move apart from each other, earthquakes, a type of tectonic hazard occurred as the grounds are moved apart.

- Some of the volcanos are near the coast, which can also lead to flooding and landslid when explonal.
