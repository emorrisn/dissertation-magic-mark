0.1.1 Using Figure 2 and your own understanding, suggest how plate movements cause tectonic hazards in Iceland.

① [6 marks]
In Figure 2, plate movements cause tectonic hazards by moving apart because it is a constructive plate tectonic plate. A constant North American plate and the Eurasian plate are moving apart at 2.5 cm per year.
