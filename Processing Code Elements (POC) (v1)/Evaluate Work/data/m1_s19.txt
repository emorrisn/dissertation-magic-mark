Plate movements cause tectonic hazards in Iceland because as the constructive plate margins move apart, it can create more volcanoes or make the existing ones erupt as they move apart. Also it says in the box that several hundred earthquakes are recorded every year sharing the mid atlantic ridge has a huge impact on Iceland as there runs very close to the capital. This is a problem as lots of people live there so it's major earthquake has to happen, it would have a big impact due to population density which is a risk factor.
