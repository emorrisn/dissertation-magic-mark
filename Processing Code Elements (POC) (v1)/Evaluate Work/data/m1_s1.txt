01.2 State two ways that planning might help to reduce the damaging effects of an earthquake or a volcanic eruption.

Planning can help to protect the areas that are most at risk. It can also be used to educate people in these areas on what to do if something does happen for example evacuation.

01.3 Explain how increasing use of fossil fuels and changes in agriculture may have contributed to changes in global temperature.

As industry grows production will need to increase and more people will need to be led so farmers and business owners seeking land may chop down forests. This will decrease the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. As stated earlier farmers will also need extra space to up production. This will lead to more methane in the atmosphere.

01.4 Explain how greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are being used to trap heat in. More greenhouse gases will also increase the Earth's temperature. This will lead to more heat being released or which leads to more heat being trapped in the atmosphere.
