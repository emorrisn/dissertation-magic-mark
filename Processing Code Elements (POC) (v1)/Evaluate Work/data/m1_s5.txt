Study Figure 2, a map of Iceland showing the tectonic plates.

*   Mid-Atlantic Ridge (plate margin)

Several hundred earthquakes are recorded in Iceland every year. Some have magnitudes of over 6 on the Richter scale.

0.1.1 Using Figure 2 and your own understanding, suggest how plate movements cause tectonic hazards in Iceland.

In Figure 2 we see that the two plates are moving apart at a rate of 2.5 cm per year. This means it is a constructive plate margin. In a constructive plate margin, the two plates move away from each other creating space, which is then filled with magma from the mantle layer. In Figure 2 the volcanoes are mainly placed along the plate margins (Mid-Atlantic ridge). Lava/magma rises up from the mantle layer because of convection currents which is when mantle heat up and rises and then cools down again. It also mentions earthquakes which are caused by friction.
