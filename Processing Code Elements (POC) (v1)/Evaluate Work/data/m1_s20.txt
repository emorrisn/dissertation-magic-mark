0.1.1 Using Figure 2 and your own understanding, suggest how plate movements cause tectonic hazards in Iceland.

(6 marks)

Plate movements cause tectonic hazards in Iceland because as the constructive plate margins move apart it can create more volcanoes or make the existing ones erupt as they move apart. Also it says in the right of the picture that several hundred earthquakes are recorded every year showing the mid-Atlantic ridge has a huge impact on Iceland as there is a fault line runs very close to the capital. This is a problem as lots of people live there so if a major earthquake was to happen, it would have a bigger impact Extra Space - AIP to population density which is a risk factor
