Study Figure 2, a map of Iceland showing the tectonic plates.

Figure 2

Key
- Mid-Atlantic Ridge (plate margin)
- Direction of plate movement
- Volcano
- Capital city
- Several hundred earthquakes are recorded in Iceland every year. Some have magnitudes of over 6 on the Richter scale.
- Rate of plate movement: 2.5 cm per year

In Figure 2 I can see that there is a constructive plate margin moving away from each other. Iceland is expanding every year because of tectonic hazards. Tectonic hazards make earthquakes happen that why several hundreds earthquakes are recorded in Iceland every year. The mid Atlantic ridge runs right through Iceland. They have many volcanoes.
