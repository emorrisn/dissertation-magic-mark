Study Figure 2, a map of Iceland showing the tectonic plates.

**Figure 2**

Key
- Mid-Atlantic Ridge (plate margin)
- Direction of plate movement
- Volcano
- Capital city
- Several hundred earthquakes are recorded in Iceland every year. Some have magnitudes of over 6 on the Richter scale.
- Rate of plate movement: 2.5 cm per year
- 0 50 100 km

In figure 2 I can see the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, each ridge marks moving 1 cm.

This ridge is a constructive plate margin. This means the North American Plate and Eurasian plate are pulling East and West Ireland away from each other. New crust emerges on the fault line and often magma rises to this gives a higher risk for volcanic eruptions to occur. However there are 18 volcanoes already displayed on the fault line because of this process.

Also, movement at constructive plate boundaries Extra Space can cause earthquakes which is proved by 200+ earthquakes every week with some having magnitude of over 5. Very powerful. These are tectonic hazards as they pose threat to human life activity.
