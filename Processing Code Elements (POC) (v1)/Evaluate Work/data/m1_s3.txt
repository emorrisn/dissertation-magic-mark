Study Figure 2, a map of Iceland showing the tectonic plates.

Figure 2

[Map of Iceland showing North American Plate and Eurasian Plate meeting at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The map includes Iceland, Reykjavik, the Atlantic Ocean, and a scale bar for 0, 50, 100 km. A key explains symbols: Mid-Atlantic Ridge (plate margin), Direction of plate movement, Volcano, Capital city. Text on the map reads "Rate of plate movement: 2.5 cm per year".]

Key
*   Mid-Atlantic Ridge (plate margin)
*   Direction of plate movement
*   Volcano
*   Capital city
*   Several hundred earthquakes are recorded in Iceland every year. Some have magnitudes of over 6 on the Richter scale.

0.1.1 Using Figure 2 and your own understanding, suggest how plate movements cause tectonic hazards in Iceland.

[6 marks]

In Figure 2 I can see the Mid-atlantic Ridge going through the middle of Iceland. I can also see at the top of Iceland that the direction of the tectonic plates are pulling away from each other. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is also going towards the capital city which could be dangerous if the tectonic plates move together. North American plates and the Eurasian plate move together.
