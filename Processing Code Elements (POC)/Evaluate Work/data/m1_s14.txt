01.3 Using Figure 2, complete the following paragraph [3 marks]
Air from the Equator rises and moves towards the poles, then cools down and sinks at approximately 30° north and south of the Equator.

The sinking air creates an area of high pressure with very little rainfall.

Some of the air moves back to the Equator as surface winds called Trade Winds.

01.4 Explain how alternative energy production and planting trees may help to reduce the rate of climate change. [4 marks]

Using alternative energy like Solar power can get rid of the need to use fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas by giving people alternatives and more eco-friendly ways to use energy. Planting trees can help reduce the amount of CO2 in the air which makes up about 87% of greenhouse gases, they can do this by taking in the CO2 and turning it into oxygen, getting rid of any carbon and giving us a better byproduct.
