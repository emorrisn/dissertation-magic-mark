Study Figure 2, a map of Iceland showing the tectonic plates.

Figure 2

[6 marks]

In Figure 2 there are volcanoes along the mid-Atlantic Ridge. This causes tectonic hazards because the direction of plate movements are moving away from each other (constructive), leading the volcanoes to erupt. Constructive plate movement causes magma to rise. This causes new crust. This explains why rate of plate movement increases 2.5cm per year.

Key
*   Mid-Atlantic Ridge (plate margin)
*   Direction of plate movement
*   Volcano
*   Capital city
*   Several hundred earthquakes are recorded in Iceland every year. Some have magnitudes of over 6 on the Richter scale.
