0.1.1 Using Figure 2 and your own understanding, suggest how plate movements cause tectonic hazards in Iceland.

① [6 marks]
In Figure 2, plate movements cause tectonic hazards by moving apart because it is constructive, plate tectonic plate. The North American plate and the Eurasian plate are moving apart at 2.5cm per year.
