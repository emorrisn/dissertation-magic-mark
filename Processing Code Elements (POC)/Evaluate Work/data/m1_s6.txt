Key
- Mid-Atlantic Ridge (plate margin)
- Direction of plate movement
- Volcano
- Capital city

Several hundred earthquakes are recorded in Iceland every year. Some have magnitudes of over 6 on the Richter scale.

0.1.1 Using Figure 2 and your own understanding, suggest how plate movements cause tectonic hazards in Iceland.

[6 marks]

Figure 2 shows that the tectonic Plates are moving apart from each other which means there constructive. This could cause volcanic eruptions or earthquakes to form. which causes tectonic hazards as the plates are moving and creates magma because of the volcano.
