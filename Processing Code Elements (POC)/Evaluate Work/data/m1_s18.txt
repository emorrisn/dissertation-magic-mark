HAZARDS 2

Study Figure 2, a map of Iceland showing the tectonic plates.

[6 marks]

0.1.1 Using Figure 2 and your own understanding suggest how plate movements cause tectonic hazards in Iceland.

In figure 2, I can see that the Mid-Atlantic Ridge gives through Iceland which is a constructive plate margin. This means the plates move apart causing volcanoes to form and more earthquakes happen. The movement of the plates cause more tectonic hazards because it forms different hazards at the plate margin. The rate of the plate movement is 2-5 cm per year which means it is moving a lot causing more natural hazards. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge goes straight through the middle of Iceland so it doesn't affect the capital city which is very good and since extra space more people will live there & that mean less deaths and injury will happen because there's no volcano's around that area. I think the plate movements cause more deaths in Iceland.
