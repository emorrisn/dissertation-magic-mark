Study Figure 2, a diagram showing the global atmospheric circulation model.

01.3 Using Figure 2, complete the following paragraph [3 marks]
Air from the Equator rises and moves towards the poles, then cools down and sinks at approximately 30° north and south of the Equator.

The sinking air creates an area of high pressure with very little rainfall.

Some of the air moves back to the Equator as surface winds called Trade Winds.

01.4 Explain how alternative energy production and planting trees may help to reduce the rate of climate change. [4 marks]

Planting trees will help to reduce the rate of climate change because as the atmosphere they take carbon dioxide (greenhouse gas) out of the atmosphere and produce oxygen which we use to breathe. Alternative energy production will help reduce the effects of climate change because they will be producing less greenhouse gases so it won't add to the greenhouse effect and not trapping the heat from the Sun in the atmosphere warming the planet.
