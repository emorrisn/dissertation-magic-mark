Study Figure 2, a map of Iceland showing the tectonic plates.

**Figure 2**

Key
- Mid-Atlantic Ridge (plate margin)
- Direction of plate movement
- Volcano
- Capital city
- Several hundred earthquakes are recorded in Iceland every year. Some have magnitudes of over 6 on the Richter scale.
- Rate of plate movement: 2.5cm per year
- Atlantic Ocean
- Reykjavik

Plate movements cause tectonic hazards when they pull away from each other which can be seen in Figure 2. When the tectonic plates push away from each other it causes hazards like Earthquakes and volcanoes to take place/cruct across the plate margin. Figure 2 shows a map of Iceland and its plate margin (Mid-Atlantic Ridge) running through the middle. This can cause some major issues as is capital city, (Reykjavik) is very close to the plate margin.
