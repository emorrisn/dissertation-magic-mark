01.4 Explain how alternative energy production and planting trees may help to reduce the rate of climate change.

[4 marks]

Alternative energy production and planting trees may help to reduce the rate of climate change because there won't be as many fossil fuels burning which may help reduce greenhouse gases. Adopting and changing what we do to learn to cope with the effects of climate change is important as we need to reduce the large mass of energy production and deforestation which will therefore be more beneficial in the future.
