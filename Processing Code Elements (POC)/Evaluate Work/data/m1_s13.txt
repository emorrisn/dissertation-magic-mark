(3 marks]
Air from the Equator rises and moves towards the poles, then cools down and sinks at approximately 30° North and South of the Equator.
High pressure creates an area of low pressure with very little rainfall.
Some of the air moves back to the Equator as surface winds called Trade Winds.

01.4 Explain how alternative energy production and planting trees may help to reduce the rate of climate change.
[4 marks]

Using Alternative energy can stop us using fossil fuels which release carbon emissions into the earth's atmosphere so much we can reduce the rate of climate change. Trees capture CO₂ when they capture CO₂ and produce oxygen. This would lower the amount of greenhouse gases rising to our Atmosphere, reducing the rate of climate change.
