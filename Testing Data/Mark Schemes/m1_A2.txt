Model Answer:
Alternative energy production, such as using wind, solar, or hydroelectric power, reduces the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil. This means less carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are released into the atmosphere, which helps slow down global warming.

Planting trees also helps because trees absorb carbon dioxide during photosynthesis, removing it from the air and storing it as carbon in their biomass. This reduces the overall concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, helping to reduce the rate of climate change.
